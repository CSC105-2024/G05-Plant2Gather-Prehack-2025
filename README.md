# G05-Plant2Gather

### Tech stack:
- Frontend: React (bun)
- Backend: Hono (bun)
- Database: PostgreSQL (prisma)

### Project Setup Instructions

**Note:** you can not run both frontend and backend properly if you don't have proper environment variable (such as prisma, google map, cloudinary, etc.) in **.env** which **we are not provided because it security reasons** but **if** you are our collaborators the website will work just fine.

**Make sure [Bun](https://bun.sh/)** is installed on your system before proceeding. You can install it by following the instructions on the official Bun website.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Open your terminal and clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

---

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**
   If you already cloned the repository:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Start the Backend Server**

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
4. **After you put everything to .env run this command to migrate database**

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

---

Everything should be up and running now! Make sure both frontend and backend servers are running concurrently for full functionality.
